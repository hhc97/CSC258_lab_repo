# CSC258_lab_repo
This repo contains all the lab work that I've done for CSC258H1 taken Winter 2020 at UofT St. George.

This course had an extremely heavy workload, and the labs were absolute Hell.  
(I've heard inviting your lab TA out for drinks will help ;)

I've decided to make this repo public, not for you to cheat off, but for future students to have a reference when doing the labs, because nobody should have to go through this course without any guidance, especially for the labs.

If you end up using this resource for your labs, please don't just copy everything. Try to understand what is going on, because while everyone I know has had a *hate-hate-hate* relationship with Verilog, some of the labs are genuinely quite interesting, and do impart some useful bits of knowledge.

Also, if you're fortunate enough to have found this repo ***before*** the semester starts, for the love of god save yourself the trouble and just take it at UTM.

Note:
The code for all 7 labs in this repo has been tested and verified to be correct, according to the specification of the Winter 2020 offering. Minor changes are made to the lab handouts each offering, but they are trivial and often only require changes to a couple lines of code. This doesn't mean you should just change those couple lines and call it a day; you need to understand what you are doing!
